Malware (short for "malicious software") can be defined as any software designed to perform malicious actions on behalf of an attacker. 
There are many different kinds of malware: we will be focussing on generic malware and ransomware specifically in this task.
Once installed, attackers commonly use malware to steal information, cause damage, or execute arbitrary commands on the infected system. 
Malware is often used to perform a set of tasks referred to as "Command and Control" (or C2/C&C). 
C2 malware connects back to a waiting server and allows an attacker to control the infected system remotely, often incorporating many simple tasks such as keylogging as built-in parts of the malicious software.

A specialised class of malware: ransomware is used to infect as many systems as possible, encrypting the data on the devices and holding it to ransom. 
If the victims pay the attackers within a set timeframe (usually via a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin), the data is theoretically returned.
Ransomware usually spreads by exploiting known vulnerabilities in commonly installed software (e.g. the Microsoft Windows operating system); it can be extremely fast-spreading once an infection begins, 
and can demand millions in ransom money. The goal of a ransomware attack is to infect as many systems as possible, 
then make as much data inaccessible as possible by encrypting it with a key known only to the attacker. Once the attack is complete, the malware usually displays a window.

There are various ways that an attacker can infect a target with malware â€” many of these revolve around social engineering or phishing attacks. 
For example, an attacker may send a victim an email containing a Microsoft Word or Excel file that contains a malicious macro (code that is embedded inside the document set to run when a user opens the file). 
These will not run by default unless the user clicks the "Enable Content" button at the top of the screen to enable macros.

the attacker may send the file as a compiled .exe , a PDF, a .ps1 PowerShell Script or 
.bat Batch script, an HTML application file ( .hta ), or even a .js JavaScript file to be executed by the JavaScript interpreter built into Windows.
Alternatively, the attacker may exploit a vulnerability in public-facing infrastructure in a corporate environment (for example, a webserver), 
thus giving themselves an opening into the internal network and allowing them to start a larger attack, facilitated by malware.
