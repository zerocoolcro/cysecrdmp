Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a human (rather than a computer) is the target;
for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "People Hacking". 
For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim's password, they could attempt to guess or brute-force the password 
or they could simply ask you.

Whilst the example linked above is relatively straightforward, social engineering attacks can become very complex and often 
result in an attacker gaining significant control over a target's life â€” both online and offline. Social engineering attacks are often 
multi-layered and escalate due to the snowball effect. For example, an attacker may start off by obtaining a small amount of publicly 
available information from a victim's social media presence, which they could then use to get more information from, say, your phone or broadband provider.
The information obtained from the second stage could then be used to gain more useful information,
then escalate step-by-step to something like the victim's bank account.

Charismatic hackers calling your phone company and taking possession of your account is one form of social engineering; however,

on tricking humans into giving the attacker access, rather than attacking the technology directly. Whilst direct interaction with 
targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) 
in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. In a similar vein, attackers may 
leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. 
In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim's device.
